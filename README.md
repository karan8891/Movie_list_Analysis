# Movie_list_Analysis
A list of movies with certain values has been analyzed and experimented by me to show valuable insights from raw data. Process involved cleaning, filtering, organizing, visualizing, and sharing data/insights.

 Step 1:
 Fetching "Movie-Data-Starter-Project"
 
 Step 2:
 Adding Filters
 
 Step 3:
 Adding Numbering system or IDs for values
 Proper borders and highlighting headers to make data more readable
 
 Step 4:
 Deleting irrelevant datasets for proper analysis
 
 Step 5:
 Visualization for insights
 
 Scenario A-
 Keeping only Num,	Movie, Title,	Release Date,	Genre (1),	Director (1),	Budget ($),	Box Office Revenue ($) coloumns
 
 ~Filtered Action Genre
 ~For Determining outliers in dataset
 ~Applying different filers to Pivot Chart to see changes
 
 Scenario B-
 
 ~Comparing success rate of directors for the same data based on Revenue generated
